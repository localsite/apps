# About Parks Theme

We're featuring the wilderness photograhy of [Artist Julie Bender](https://www.juliebender.com/).


We'd like to pull [National Park info/locations and display park images from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States)  
using the [Github Action script](../../community/projects/#github-actions) created by Abrie initially to scrape state carbon footprints.
