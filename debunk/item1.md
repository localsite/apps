## Myth: Wind Turbines vs. "Clean Coal"

### Claim: Overall Carbon Footprint

TODO production vs. recurring emissions

### Claim: Direct Environmental Harm

TODO birds etc.

There are claims that wind turbines kill a lot of birds. 
In fact, only a small percentage of birds get killed by wind turbines.
Most non-natural bird deaths are caused by other hazards.
