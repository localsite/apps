## About our Sustainable Community Project

**Project Impact**

Our project attempts to make a broad, real-world impact in raising awareness of sustainability challenges in these areas:

  - Air quality
  - Urban agriculture
  - Biodiesel production and local consumption (intercampus shuttle)
  - Composting
  - Volunteering/activism

**Innovation**

Our community sustainability page is innovative and creative and takes a novel approach by integrating content from these various areas and attempting to provide a replicable structure as well as attempt to inspire other institutions.

**Clarity**

Our project includes the following to make information and tools clear, accessible, and easy to understand: Widgets and project descriptions.

<!--Does it present information clearly?-->

**Implementation**

Our community sustainability page provides a new functional solution in the area(s) of the use of IO widgets in project-specific ways.

**Integration**

New additions created for our project integrate with PurpleAir sensor data and (in the future) ZCTA impact data.
