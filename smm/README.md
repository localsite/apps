Our 3.0 mockup combines the functionality of the EPA's [SSM Prioritization Tool](https://www.epa.gov/smm/smm-prioritization-tools-index) with a web-based [OpenLCA Tabulator](https://www.openlca.org/).  
Interfaces are designed to be embedded under multiple website domains.  

Help us integrate UI design elements as we integrate the [EIOLCA.net](http://www.eiolca.net/cgi-bin/dft/use.pl) Environmental Impact Interface.
