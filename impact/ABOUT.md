## About ZCTA Impacts

**Project Impact**

[ZCTAImpacts](https://zctaimpacts.abrie.dev) makes a real-world impact by showing the aggregated environmental effect of local industries in a concise, accessible format.

**Innovation**

The app provides a simple search interface. Users are able to search by state, county, or zipcode and get an overview of the area's environmental impact. The overview is presented as a ["Nutrition Label"](https://model.earth/io/template/), indicating its contribution to the ["metabolism of the anthroposphere"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropogenic_metabolism)

**Clarity**

[https://github.com/abrie/ZCTAImpacts](https://github.com/abrie/ZCTAImpacts) provides a repository with source code and a script to build the required database from scratch.

**Implementation**

The app fuses the EPA's USEEIO v2 to US Census Business Patterns through a searchable interface. It uses a React frontend and a Python backend.

**Integration**

The app provides a JSON API for querying the aggregated community totals. It's the same API used to generate the nutritional labels. Consumers of the API could use the data to generate a more compelling label, rank a set of communities, or measure local environmental trends over time.
